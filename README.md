WHAT WENT WRONG
-----

Starting work before pulling from MASTER branch

Two people working on the same file at the same time

Working on the MASTER branch, period

WHAT SHOULD HAVE HAPPENED
======

Do not work on the MASTER branch, conflicts are easier to resolve in PRs from branches

One PR at a time. One pull request should be done, followed by a pull to master by all contributors
